                </strong>
            </p>


            <p>
                <strong>
                    The official Chronicler of the Foliccite Church has agreed to create a series of posts summarizing the history of the Follicles (the species that our Emperor belongs to)
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Long before time had a name, there was nothing. Then, 20 follicles appeared from the void, 10 male, and 10 female. These were the First Follicles and spoke Old Folliccanese, whose descendent, Folliccanese, is still the main language of the Follicles. They recognized that they would need to create
                    a world for them to live in, and so they began. We do not know for certain which follicles created what, but from a few scattered fragments of the ancient tomes, we can gather
                    that a follicle named Nãmnʳ created the pink seas, one named Hxé created evergreen forests, and one, whose name has been obscured by the fading ink, created the Follicle Fjords.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    These 20 Follicles eventually came to choose the Follicle Fjords as their main settlement. They then paired up to start 10 families. These 10 families would become
                    the 10 Follicle Tribes. Each tribe had a slightly different colour of fur, with the First tribe having an deep orange coat, while the Tenth Tribe having a Chartreuse coat, and all the Tribes
                    in between having a colour somewhere between these extremes. Over time, these differences created class divisions. The exact divisions depends on the time period, for example, between 
                    the 13ᵗʰ and 15ᵗʰ centuries, it was the First Follicle Tribe (who prefers to be called the First Follicle Family, in English at least). This period of First Follicle
                    Family supremacy was the last period where class divisions were based on one's ancestry. After this period, class was, and still is, determined by things such as political
                    power, actual power, money, &c.

                <strong>
                    In response to the leaders of the Church moving onto a different school soon, there will be a referrendum for Leader of the Local Branch after Winter Break. There are currently two candidates. If you have any candidates you want to volunteer, e-mail them to the address provided in the REQUESTS Tab.
