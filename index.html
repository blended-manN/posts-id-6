                </strong>
            </p>


            <p>
                <strong>
                    The official Chronicler of the Foliccite Church has agreed to create a series of posts summarizing the history of the Follicles (the species that our Emperor belongs to)
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Long before time had a name, there was nothing. Then, 20 follicles appeared from the void, 10 male, and 10 female. These were the First Follicles and spoke Old Folliccanese, whose descendent, Folliccanese, is still the main language of the Follicles. They recognized that they would need to create
                    a world for them to live in, and so they began. We do not know for certain which follicles created what, but from a few scattered fragments of the ancient tomes, we can gather
                    that a follicle named Nãmnʳ created the pink seas, one named Hxé created evergreen forests, and one, whose name has been obscured by the fading ink, created the Follicle Fjords.
                </strong>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    These 20 Follicles eventually came to choose the Follicle Fjords as their main settlement. They then paired up to start 10 families. These 10 families would become
                    the 10 Follicle Tribes. Each tribe had a slightly different colour of fur, with the First tribe having an deep orange coat, while the Tenth Tribe having a Chartreuse coat, and all the Tribes
                    in between having a colour somewhere between these extremes. Over time, these differences created class divisions. The exact divisions depends on the time period, for example, between 
                    the 13ᵗʰ and 15ᵗʰ centuries, it was the First Follicle Tribe (who prefers to be called the First Follicle Family, in English at least). This period of First Follicle
                    Family supremacy was the last period where class divisions were based on one's ancestry. After this period, class was, and still is, determined by things such as political
                    power, actual power, money, &c.

                <strong>
                    Human History, as you may know, is distinctly devoid of Follicles, and that's because the Follicle Realm exists outside of our realm. In fact, our realm was created by the second
                    generation of Follicles, as they wanted in on the creation business. Follicles have historically seen humans as we see animals, capable of thought an emotion, but they kind of just exist.
                    Only a couple of Dozen Follicles have ever visited the Human Realm, and even fewer have interacted with humans. Now, you may know one Follicle that has interacted with humans, our 
                    Emperor, Lord Sir Señor Mr. Follicle. He is the first Follicle to ever establish a domain on Earth. He is of the First Follicle Family, but due to his yellow fur, he was suspected
                    to have been born out of wedlock (though no one can confirm nor deny this as of now). Because of this, he was labelled a disgrace to the family name, so they only gave him the family name, Follicle.
                    Follicles, much like humans, have family names and individual names, in our Emperor's case, his family found him such a disgrace that he was given no individual name. With this feeling of 
                    dissappointment weighing on him his entire childhood, he decided to break tradition and move to the Human Realm for good. This is where he found the First Carrier in a Comic Book Store, and the Church was founded.

                    The Chronicler has agreeed to make another brief Follicle history when he gets his notes in order.
