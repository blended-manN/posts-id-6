                <strong>
                        Mr. Follicle has found himself a Mrs. Follicle
                </strong>
            </p>


            <p>
                <strong>
                    A week  ago, Mrs. Follicle successfully crossed the border between the Follicle Realm and Our Realm. She comes from the Third Follicle Family, one of the most noblest Follicle Families. Mr. Follicle is very greatful 
                    to have her.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Mrs. Follicle has said, "This is quite unusual for a member of the First Follicle Family [that Mr. Follicle comes from]. They would usually not 
                    come into contact with other realms. But Lord Follicle is different, he defies the norms of Follicle society. He was rejected from the First Follicle Family 
                    and still made a name for himself, for better or for worse. That's why I'm with him." 
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    In the Church, there are now two carriers. Originally there was one, the one that carried Mr. Follicle. Now there are two, the other being the High Priestess. The 
                    High Priestess is now in charge of Mr. Follicle's travels, while the original carrier is now in charge of Mrs. Follicle's travels. Here's Mrs. Follicle's opinion 
                    on the High Priestess.
                </strong>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    "I don't mind him, really. At least he speaks Folliccanese."
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    In response to the leaders of the Church moving onto a different school soon, there will be a referrendum for Leader of the Local Branch after Winter Break. There are currently two candidates. If you have any candidates you want to volunteer, e-mail them to the address provided in the REQUESTS Tab.
